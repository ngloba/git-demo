I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize

The Captain wants to be back home
And the Captain fights against a storm
He's always true to me
He always wants to live and be back home
